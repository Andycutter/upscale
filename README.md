# Craft Academy Rails 5.2 Upscale

In order to get you started with Rails, we've set up a Upscale application using the following setup:
* Rails 5.2
* Cucumber - acceptance testing framework
* RSpec - testing framework that we will be using for unit testing
* ShouldaMatchers - to simplify our testing in RSpec


## Setup

1 Copy the url an clone the repository to you `localhost`

2 In terminal, inside the project folder, run the following command to **remove** the Git original repository:

  ```
  $ rm -rf .git
  ```

3 And initiate a new repository (that will give you a clean state)

  ```
  $ git init
  ```

4 Now, head over to GitHub and create a new repository on your account. Copy the repo url, and add it as your `origin` remote.

```
$ git remote add origin <your repo url>
```

5 Run `bundle install` and `rails db:create db:migrate` in your terminal (in the project folder)

This should give you a clean repo history.
